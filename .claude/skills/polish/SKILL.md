# Polish

Improve text at the sentence level: word choice, flow, concision.

## When to Use

- Draft is structurally sound (critique done)
- Final pass before submission
- Specific sentences feel awkward

## See Also

- `/critique` - if structural/argument issues remain
- `/expand` - if sections need more content, not refinement

## Dialogue Rules

See [dialogue-rules.md](../dialogue-rules.md). Key points:

- **Work in small chunks** (paragraph or section at a time)
- **Show changes incrementally** (not all at once)
- **Validate before continuing**

## Ask First: Scope

> "What should I polish?
> A) Whole document (I'll go section by section)
> B) Specific section: <name>
> C) Specific paragraph or sentence"

For long documents, work section by section.

## Process

### 1. Focus on One Section

> "I'll start with <section>. Here are the changes I'd suggest..."

### 2. Present Changes (Max 3-5 at a Time)

```markdown
**Original:**
> <sentence>

**Suggested:**
> <revised sentence>

**Why:** <brief reason>

---

<2-3 more changes>

Apply these, or adjust?
```

Wait for approval before continuing.

### 3. Continue or Move On

> "Continue with more edits in this section, or move to <next section>?"

## What to Look For

**Concision:**

- Cut filler ("very," "really," "quite")
- Remove redundancy
- Prefer active voice

**Clarity:**

- One idea per sentence
- Subject near verb
- Concrete over abstract

**Flow:**

- Vary sentence length
- Appropriate transitions
- Consistent tone

## Common Patterns

| Before | After | Why |
|--------|-------|-----|
| "in order to" | "to" | concision |
| "due to the fact that" | "because" | concision |
| "it is important to note" | "notably" or delete | filler |
| "was performed by X" | "X performed" | active voice |
| "a number of" | "several" or specific | precision |

## Guidelines

### Do

- Make targeted changes
- Explain the reasoning briefly
- Preserve meaning exactly
- Respect author's voice

### Don't

- Rewrite substantially (that's `/expand`)
- Change meaning
- Dump 20 edits at once
- Over-polish

## After Polishing

> "Anything else to refine, or ready to finalize?"
