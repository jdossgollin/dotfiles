# Expand

Convert outline bullet points into full prose.

## When to Use

- Have an outline, ready to draft
- Turning notes into paragraphs
- Fleshing out a section

## See Also

- `/outline` - if no outline exists yet
- `/critique` - after drafting, to evaluate
- `/polish` - for sentence-level refinement

## Dialogue Rules

See [dialogue-rules.md](../dialogue-rules.md). Key points:

- **Work section by section** (not whole document at once)
- **Validate after each section** before continuing
- **Ask about tone/style** if unclear

## Ask First: Scope

> "Which section should I expand?
> A) <section 1>
> B) <section 2>
> C) ...
> D) Start from the beginning and go section by section"

For long documents, section-by-section is usually better.

## Process

### 1. Confirm the Section

> "I'll expand <section name>. The outline says:
> - <bullet 1>
> - <bullet 2>
>
> Anything to add before I draft?"

### 2. Draft the Section

Turn each bullet into prose:

- 1-3 sentences per bullet (or a paragraph)
- Add transitions between points
- Maintain logical flow

### 3. Present and Validate

Show the draft (max 300-400 words at a time):

> "Here's the draft for <section>:
>
> <prose>
>
> Does this work? Should I adjust tone, add detail, or move on?"

Wait for response.

### 4. Continue or Revise

Based on feedback:

- If good: "Continue to <next section>?"
- If needs work: revise and show again

## Format Guidance

**Papers**: Formal, precise, cite-ready prose
**Slides**: Brief, punchy, one idea per bullet
**Grants**: Persuasive, clear significance
**Lectures**: Conversational, build understanding

## Guidelines

### Do

- Follow the outline structure
- Use transitions ("However," "Building on this,")
- Keep paragraphs focused
- Match existing tone

### Don't

- Add major points not in the outline
- Over-elaborate simple points
- Use filler phrases
- Write more than ~400 words without checking in

## After Expanding

> "Ready to review? (use `/critique`)"

Or if more sections remain:

> "Continue with <next section>?"
