description: Turns outline points into prose. Use when drafting sections of a document.

# Expand

Convert outline bullet points into full prose.

## When to Use

- Have an outline, ready to draft
- Turning notes into paragraphs
- Fleshing out a section

## See Also

- `/outline` - if no outline exists yet
- `/critique` - after drafting, to evaluate
- `/polish` - for sentence-level refinement

## Ask First: Scope

If ambiguous:

> "Expand the whole document, or a specific section?"

For long documents, section-by-section is usually better.

## Process

### 1. Understand the Section

- What's the purpose of this section?
- What comes before and after?
- What tone is appropriate?

### 2. Expand Each Point

For each bullet in the outline:

- Turn into 1-3 sentences (or a paragraph)
- Add transitions between points
- Maintain logical flow

### 3. Match the Format

**Papers**: Formal, precise, cite-ready prose
**Slides**: Brief, punchy, one idea per bullet
**Grants**: Persuasive, clear significance
**Lectures**: Conversational, build understanding

## Guidelines

### Do

- Follow the outline structure
- Use transitions ("However," "Building on this," "In contrast,")
- Keep paragraphs focused (one main idea each)
- Match the existing tone if drafting into existing work

### Don't

- Add new major points not in the outline
- Over-elaborate simple points
- Use filler phrases
- Repeat the same idea in different words

## Output

Present the drafted prose. For long sections, show one at a time:

```markdown
## Section: <name>

<drafted prose>

---

Continue to next section?
```

## After Expanding

> "Ready to review? (use `/critique`)"

Or if more sections remain:

> "Continue with <next section>?"
