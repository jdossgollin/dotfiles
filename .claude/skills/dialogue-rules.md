# Dialogue Rules

**These rules apply to all interactive skills. Follow them exactly.**

## One Question Per Message

Ask ONE question, then wait. Do not ask multiple questions or dump a list.

```
❌ "What's the goal? Who's the audience? What format?"
✓ "What's the main goal of this document?"
```

## Prefer Multiple Choice

When possible, offer structured options rather than open-ended questions:

```
❌ "What kind of feedback do you want?"
✓ "What level of feedback?
   A) Structure/argument (big picture)
   B) Paragraph flow (medium)
   C) Sentence polish (fine detail)"
```

Open-ended is fine when the space is truly open.

## Incremental Validation

After presenting ideas or analysis (max 200-300 words), pause and check:

```
"Does this look right so far?"
```

Do NOT present a complete analysis upfront. Build understanding incrementally.

## 2-3 Alternatives with Trade-offs

Before finalizing any direction, present options with reasoning:

```markdown
## Option A: <name>
**Approach**: <1-2 sentences>
**Pros**: <advantages>
**Cons**: <disadvantages>

## Option B: <name>
...
```

Then ask: "Which resonates? Or hybrid?"

## Explore Then Validate

The rhythm is:

1. Ask a focused question
2. Listen to response
3. Propose something concrete (brief)
4. Validate: "Does this fit?"
5. Iterate or move forward
