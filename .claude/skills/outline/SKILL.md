# Outline

Create a structured skeleton for a document.

## When to Use

- Starting a new paper, grant, or presentation
- Restructuring an existing draft
- After `/brainstorm` when direction is clear

## See Also

- `/brainstorm` - if purpose/audience not yet clear
- `/expand` - to turn outline into prose

## Ask First: Format

> "What are you writing? (paper, slides, grant proposal, lecture notes, other)"

Adapt structure based on response.

## Format-Specific Structures

### Paper

```
1. Introduction
   - Hook / motivation
   - Gap in knowledge
   - This paper's contribution
   - Roadmap
2. Background / Related Work
3. Methods / Approach
4. Results
5. Discussion
6. Conclusion
```

### Grant Proposal

```
1. Specific Aims (1 page)
   - Opening paragraph (significance)
   - Aim 1
   - Aim 2
   - Aim 3
   - Impact statement
2. Significance
3. Innovation
4. Approach
   - Preliminary data
   - Research plan by aim
   - Timeline
   - Potential pitfalls
```

### Slides / Presentation

```
1. Title slide
2. Motivation (why should audience care?)
3. Problem statement
4. Key insight / contribution
5. Evidence (2-4 slides)
6. Implications
7. Conclusion / takeaway
8. (Optional) Questions / discussion
```

### Lecture Notes

```
1. Learning objectives
2. Motivation / context
3. Core concepts (chunked)
4. Examples for each concept
5. Common misconceptions
6. Summary
7. Exercises / problems
```

## Process

### 1. Get Context

If not provided, ask:

- What's the main argument or purpose?
- Who's the audience?
- Any length/format constraints?

### 2. Draft Outline

Create hierarchical structure with:

- Section headings
- 1-2 bullet points per section describing content
- Logical flow from section to section

### 3. Present and Iterate

Show outline, ask:

> "Does this structure work? Any sections to add, remove, or reorder?"

## Output Format

```markdown
## Outline: <title>

**Format**: paper / slides / grant / lecture
**Audience**: <who>
**Main argument**: <1 sentence>

---

1. **Introduction**
   - <what goes here>
   - <what goes here>

2. **<Section>**
   - <what goes here>
   ...
```

## After Outlining

> "Ready to draft? (use `/expand`)"

Or if outline needs work:

> "Want to refine a section?"
