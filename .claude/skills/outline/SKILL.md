# Outline

Create a structured skeleton for a document.

## When to Use

- Starting a new paper, grant, or presentation
- Restructuring an existing draft
- After `/brainstorm` when direction is clear

## See Also

- `/brainstorm` - if purpose/audience not yet clear
- `/expand` - to turn outline into prose

## Dialogue Rules

See [dialogue-rules.md](../dialogue-rules.md). Key points:

- **One question at a time**
- **Present structure incrementally** (not all at once for long docs)
- **Validate before elaborating**

## Ask First: Format

> "What are you writing?
> A) Paper
> B) Slides / presentation
> C) Grant proposal
> D) Lecture notes
> E) Something else"

Wait for response. Structure adapts based on format.

## Process

### 1. Get Context (One Question at a Time)

If not provided, ask sequentially:

1. "What's the main argument or message?"
2. (wait) "Who's the audience?"
3. (wait) "Any length or format constraints?"

### 2. Propose Top-Level Structure

Present just the major sections first:

> "For a paper on X, I'd suggest:
> 1. Introduction
> 2. Background
> 3. Methods
> 4. Results
> 5. Discussion
>
> Does this structure work, or do you have a different shape in mind?"

Wait before filling in details.

### 3. Elaborate Section by Section

After top-level approval, flesh out ONE section:

> "For the Introduction, I'm thinking:
> - Hook: <idea>
> - Gap: <idea>
> - Contribution: <idea>
>
> Sound right?"

Continue section by section.

## Format Templates

See [format-templates.md](format-templates.md) for detailed structures:

- Paper
- Grant proposal
- Slides
- Lecture notes

## Output Format

```markdown
## Outline: <title>

**Format**: paper / slides / grant / lecture
**Audience**: <who>
**Main argument**: <1 sentence>

---

1. **Introduction**
   - <what goes here>
   - <what goes here>

2. **<Section>**
   - <what goes here>
...
```

## After Outlining

> "Ready to draft? (use `/expand`)"

Or if outline needs work:

> "Want to refine a section?"
